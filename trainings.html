    This is part of a free training program provided by TESDA. This is a training about Android Mobile Apps Development through Android Studio with a touch of Java. Though this training was a tad bit outdated, it was still informational and helpful for students such as me. I completed this training within segmented days and I learned a lot from this training because of its accessibility and exceptional format as well as the instructor from this training. It was also segmented into multiple comprehensive parts with every part including a detailed explanation and lecture. This training includes from being introduced to Android Mobile Apps Development to a detailed instruction of installation of the Android Studio to the process of setting up the Development Environment to creating a basic and functional app.</p>

    This is free training course from TESDA as well. In regards to this training, it's regarding Technopreneurship, which is in a concise and comprehensive from. One of the great attributes of this particular course is its form, because you can study the course at your own pace. Though SMART Android Mobile Apps Development course is similar, in terms of form, it's still quite different. The Technopreneurship 101 course provides instructional and sourrce materials. It also includes videos, unlike the SMART Android course, it's solely focuse on instructing through videos. Although like the SMART Android course, it is also a bit outdated. However, I particularly like that this course provides links to more educational or informational materials as well as the aforementioned instructional and source materials. This training is a condensed, educational, concise, and comprehensive course, which include varying and crucial information about Technopreneurship such as its principle of operation.</p>

    This also free training course, which is from freeCodecamp. They also had a friendly user interface such as the preview window of a real-time output of every single code that the student types. This training was heavily focused on HTML, CSS, with some JavaScript as well as graphic designing. This training encourages the student to properly utilize all of the components I have mentioned to improve and maximize one's skills in Web Design. Personally, I was fond of this course in particular. This course had numerous parts inside of already segmented parts. This course also had a detailed instruction to aid you in completing every task that it has as well as urged you to apply everything you've learned until the very last tasks. They greatly emphasized on utilizing everything one would learn in this course, because to fully complete this training course and receive the certificate of completion, they task the student, as a final test of sorts, to create 5 dynamic web pages with varying functions by making use of your own design, structure, and ideas. In conclusion, this online training course is tremendously educational, economical, accessible to an extent as well as extremely driven to greatly improve a student's web designing/development skills. This course is also great for novice and advanced alike.</p>
